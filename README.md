# POP1Nix

Welcome to the ultimate way to play Prince of Persia 1 on UNIX systems using Nix flakes! 

This project uses DOSBOX-X, a DOS emulator, with some cool patches to give you a smooth gaming experience.
üåü

## How to Play

You can dive right into the action with this command:

```bash
nix run "github:matteo-pacini/pop1nix#pop1"
```

This command sets up everything, mounts the game directory, and launches Prince of Persia 1 using the patched DOSBOX-X.

Don't Have Flakes and nix-command Enabled? No Worries!

If you haven't enabled flakes and nix-command, you can still join the fun. Just use this command:


```bash
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run "github:matteo-pacini/pop1nix#pop1"
```

## Technical Magic ü™Ñ

- Wrapper Script: This nifty script initializes DOSBOX-X, mounts the game directory, and starts the game for you.
- External Patch: Changes the macOS app title to "PrinceOfPersia".
- Inline patch: Hardcodes the window title to "PrinceOfPersia" for a uniform look on all platforms.

## macOS Goodies üçè

- Custom titlebar title in the .app Info.plist.
- A custom icon to replace the default DOSBOX-X icon.
